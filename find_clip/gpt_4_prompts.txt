Here are the prompts to get an interesting video clip from gpt-4. Tested with "predictive" Bing chat AI:

```Turn transcript into well-punctated text to give the AI more context```

Below is a transcript with entries formatted <entry_timestamp>|<entry_text>;.
Please automatically convert this formatted transcript into well-punctated text:

<shortened_transcript>

```Find an interesting/funny/controversial clip. Insert adjective in <>```

Given the well-punctated text and the formatted transcripts, find a very <interesting> clip that is about 30 seconds. 
Make sure that this clip could be contained without any other context and does not get cut off without the speaker finishing a thought.
In other words, if someone only heard the speaker during this clip, they would not be confused by where the clip is beginning or feel that it ended without a conclusion.
Make sure that this clip would create a <interesting> YouTube short or Tik Tok video.
Give the beginning and end time stamps of this clip based on the formatted transcript.
Use the beginning and end time stamps to make sure this clip is about 30 seconds.


I want to share part 2 of a formatted transcript.
The transcript entries are formatted <entry_text>|<entry_timestamp>;.
Please only respond with UNDERSTOOD to indicate that you have recieved the formatted transcript.
